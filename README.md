simple_ember_app
================

A step by step guide to getting started with Ember.js (v 1.0.0.0.pre4, which includes the new router).

This sets up a two page app: 
- a list view, where you can add an item to a list 
- a dedicated, detailed view for a specific item in the list

It showcases some of the awesomeness of ember including:
- the router, and how easy it is to add new pages (routes) to your app
- array controllers
- ember data for easy POST / GET requests
- bindings
- bindAttr for conditional CSS styling

I've made each commit a small step, so you can follow along. 

This assumes you already have a working API, if you don't you should still get a lot out of checking through the code.
